We previously saw that population might be impacting the number of sightings. We will now get some data to check that. A package called `tidycensus` can be very helpful for getting this kind of data.

## Load our tools and data


First we need to load our tools - including the tidyverse and also read in the data, which we can do directly in R. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(DT)
UFO <- read_rds("UFO_clean.rds")
US_2014 <- read_rds("UFO_2014.rds")
lower_states <- read_rds("lower_states.rds")
```
